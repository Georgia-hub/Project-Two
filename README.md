## **Planning Stage**
### Project Goals
The plan was to create a simple classic version of Rock Paper Scissors game. The goal of this project was to create a fun yet simple game easy to interactive with.

### User Goals
The target user is to beat the computer by choosing the winner hand.
* A gamer who casually plays games by chance.
* A user who likes to play a easy an easy fun game.
* A user who needs to waste sometime.

### User Stories
* As a user I want the site to be fun and interactive.
* As a user I want to be able to understand how to play easily.
* As a user I want to be able to keep trying to better my score continusly.
* As a user I want to be able to use the controls at ease.
* As a user I want to be able to visually see the score.

### Design Goals
* A classic version of the game.
* Customisation possiblities.
* user friendly controls.
* A returned user.

### Design Choices
#### Color Scheme
I orginally was going to choose a green back ground to go with the mustard colour schemes for my emojis buttond and make this colour. After putting this colour together on the game the emojis poped out and looked better with a blue background. This is why i choose the yellow for the interactive buttons so they are the center standing piece on the game.

## **Features**

- Score tally
- button otptions

## **Features to be added**
All projects are never finshed and are constantly improving your development. For my next project i would like to add the following features:
* Improved graphics.
* add a popup box for looser and winner.
* Set the score to a number of points to level up in to another round.
* More content.
* choose of game modes

## **Testing**
i have tested each funstionn and responsive elements as i wrote them out. I have used a number functions that maniplulate elemnets as i haev instructed them to.

### Responsiveness
My website is completely responsive, fit for purpose and also fits to scale depeding on the device played on for maximum game play. I orginally had an issue with the button not tallying the score but this was down to an error in the code but this was rectified.
