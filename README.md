### Game rules
The player can click either the rock paper or scissors as many times as they want to beat the computers random selection and win the game. If they choose an option that looses then the computer will win. Rock wins against scissors, scissors wins over paper and paper beats rock.

### User Goals
The target user is to beat the computer by choosing the winner hand.
* A gamer who casually plays games by chance.
* A user who likes to play a easy an easy fun game.
* A user who needs to waste sometime.

### User Stories
* As a user I want the site to be fun and interactive.
* As a user I want to be able to understand how to play easily.
* As a user I want to be able to keep trying to better my score continusly.
* As a user I want to be able to use the controls at ease.
* As a user I want to be able to visually see the score.

### Design Goals
* A classic version of the game.
* Customisation possiblities.
* user friendly controls.
* A returned user.

### Design Choices
#### Color Scheme
I orginally was going to choose a green back ground to go with the mustard colour schemes for my emojis buttond and make this colour. After putting this colour together on the game the emojis poped out and looked better with a blue background. This is why i choose the yellow for the interactive buttons so they are the center standing piece on the game.

## **Features**

- Score tally
- 3x buttons used.
- random outcome each time

## **Features to be added**
All projects are never finshed and are constantly improving your development. For my next project i would like to add the following features:
* Improved graphics.
* add a popup box for looser and winner.
* Set the score to a number of points to level up in to another round.
* More content.
* choose of game modes

## **Testing**
i have tested each funstionn and responsive elements as i wrote them out. I have used a number functions that maniplulate elemnets as i haev instructed them to.

### Responsiveness
My website is completely responsive, fit for purpose and also fits to scale depeding on the device played on for maximum game play. I orginally had an issue with the button not tallying the score but this was down to an error in the code but this was rectified. 

### LightHouse
Before running Lighthouse I made sure that i checked my code for errors.
All HTML files were run through (https://validator.w3.org/) and my CSS file was run through (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to ensure all code meets the correct standard. 
For my javasscript, this was run through (https://jshint.com/).

## **Bugs**
During the development of rock paper scissors i had a few bugs to overcome which were mostly mistakes.

### Fixed Bugs
Firstly, i couldnt get the increment function to work, this was due to having a speeling mistake in the function sections itself. I also had a bug when i was trying to link CSS, this was due to needing the refersh the the live browser of the game.
